                    Sixteen audience members follow an insular high school friend group as they stumble from adolescence to adulthood. But in this show’s beguiling world, a coming-of-age might just come around more than once. What are wayward youth to do when faced with the opportunity to turn back the clock and re-write their most precarious moments?

                    The Brouhaha Theatre Project makes its return to Prospect Park with a dreamy immersive experience that takes its audience into some of the park's most enchanting corners.
